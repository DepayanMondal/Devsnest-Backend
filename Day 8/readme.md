## Take aways of today's lecture:
------------------------

**app.use() to use a middleware before every api call**

Get is stored in cache.
Hence not used for passwords.


Middleares mostly used for authentication and login e.g.
```
app.get("/", (req,res,next) => {
   if(req.query.admin === 'true'){
       next();
   }
   else {
       res.status(401).send("should be admin");
   }
})
```

check the get call on localhost:5000/?admin=true;
```
express.use(express.static('public'))
```
since, body parser is depricated, it is added ultimately to express
```
app.use(express.urlencoded());
app.use(bodyparser.json());
```
path that you provide to the express.static function is relative to the directory from where you launch your node :
So,
``` 
const path = require('path')
app.use('/static', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
```
